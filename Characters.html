		<h1>Character Profiles</h1>
		<font size= "5"> Will </font>
		<p>
		Orphaned as a child, Will grew up in the castle warden
		with other orphans. Small, quick witted and
		a nimble thinker, he has been chosen for the Ranger Corps and is now an apprentice to Halt.
		</p>
		<font size= "5"> Halt </font>
		<p>
		Halt is part of the Ranger Corps, a group of 50 who answer only to the King. He has taken Will as his apprentice.
		Unsmiling and always ready to speak his mind, he is a formidable figure at first glance. However he has a sense of
		dry and sarcastic humor, and is responsible for the reformation of the Ranger Corps.
		</p>
		<font size= "5"> Horace</font>
		<p>
		Horace is an orphan and was a rival to Will. Sent to Battleschool to train for knighthood, he easily masters the art
		and becomes one skilled fighter. Several events occur and cause him and Will to become life friends.
		</p>
		 <font size= "5"> Alyss</font>
		<p>
		Another orphan, she grew up with Will and Horace and became Will's childhood sweetheart. Tall, blonde and confident, she is
		training to become a courier, under the watchful eye of Lady Pauline, Halt's love (but he won't admit it.)
		</p>
		<font size= "5">  Evanlyn </font>
		<p>
		Will and Horace find Evanlyn wandering in the neighboring country of Celtica. She quickly proves herself as a vital 
		asset in helping them prevent Morgorath's army from swarming into Araluen. Her true identity is Princess Cassandra,
		heir to the Araluen throne, but to Will and Horace, she will always be Evanlyn.
		</p>
		<font size= "5">  Gilan  </font>
		<p>
		Gilan, formerly Halt's apprentice, is another Ranger in the corps. His specialty lies on stealth and moving without
		being heard. He grew up as the son of a Battlemaster, and had trained to become a swordsman before he joined the Corps.
		As a result, he is the only Ranger who is allowed to carry a sword.
		</p>
		<font size="5"> Crowley </font>
		<p>
		Crowley is the current Ranger Commandant and one of Halt's closest friends. He and Halt are
		responsible for revitalizing the Ranger Corps.
